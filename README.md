# **Data Analysis and Visualization Portfolio Description:**
In this data analysis portfolio, I present an in-depth analysis of sales data using Python and data visualization using Tableau. This analysis covers various key aspects of understanding business performance and provides valuable insights for decision-makers.

## **Indicators used**
**Sales Trends by Year and by Month:**
   - Annual and monthly sales trend visualization provides a deep understanding of sales performance over time. This allows the identification of seasonal patterns and long-term trends.

**Total Revenue, Total Sales, Total Product:**
   - This visualization provides a comprehensive overview of financial performance, total sales, and the diversity of products offered.

**Average Delivery Time:**
   - Average delivery time analysis helps evaluate supply chain efficiency and understand how quickly products reach customers.

**Number of Transactions by Product and by Day:**
   - This information provides insight into product popularity and daily purchasing patterns, helping in stock management and marketing.

**Map of Sales Performance by State:**
    - Sales map visualization shows the geographic distribution of sales performance across states, providing local and regional insights.

**Satisfaction Level by Delivery Time and Percentage of Satisfaction Level:**
    - Analysis of customer satisfaction regarding delivery times provides an overview of the quality of the service provided.

**Average Delivery Time by State:**
    - Understanding average delivery times by location helps identify areas that may require improvement in logistics services.

## **Methodology:**
**1. Data Wrangling:**
    - Data cleaning and preparation, including handling missing values and merging data from multiple sources to ensure data cleanliness and consistency.

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis:**
    - Analysis is carried out on sales trends per year and per month, with emphasis on total revenue, total sales, total products sold, and average delivery time.

**3. Interactive Data Visualization with Tableau:**
    - Creation of an interactive dashboard that provides a comprehensive overview of sales performance.
    - Key statistics such as total revenue, total sales, and total products sold are presented in easy-to-understand graphic form.
    - Visualization of average delivery times and exploration of transactions per product and per day to gain further insights.
    - Interactive maps visualize sales performance by state.
    - Customer satisfaction analysis is displayed via satisfaction graphs and satisfaction level percentages.
    - Comparison of average delivery times between states allows further understanding of delivery performance.

With this project, a comprehensive data analysis methodology was applied to produce visualizations that can provide a deep understanding of sales performance, customer satisfaction, and other key factors in a business.
